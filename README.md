wqo_shuswap
============================

### Usage

These scripts download water quality data from the British Columbia Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy's [Environmental Monitoring System Database](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/bc-environmental-monitoring-system-results "EMS Database") using `rems`.

There are four core scripts that are required for the analysis, they need to be run in order:

-   1\_load.R
-   2\_filter_and_clean.R
-   3\_visualize.R
-   4\_plots_and_tables.R

#### Example

This set of scripts allows you to sort and visualize water quality lake data for a variety of parameters.

``` r
# Initial Visualization
TP <- filter(shuswap_clean, PARAMETER == "Phosphorus Total")

# Change units from mg/L to ug/L
TP <- transform(TP, RESULT = RESULT*1000) 
TP$UNIT <- "ug/L"

sites <- c("E206771", "0500124", "E208723", "0500123")

for (s in sites){
  TP_plots <- filter(TP, EMS_ID == s)
  plotpoint <- ggplot(TP_plots, aes(x = COLLECTION_START, y = RESULT)) +
    geom_point() +
    ggtitle(s) +
    xlab("Date") +
    ylab("Total Phosphorus (Âµg/L)")
  plot(plotpoint)
}
```
